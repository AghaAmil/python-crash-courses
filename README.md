# Python Crash Course Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains all the codes, challenges, and knowledge that I have gathered while learning Python programming
through **Sololearn** and **Programiz** crash courses.

## Purpose

The aim of this repository is to:

- Document my learning journey.
- Practice Python programming by solving coding challenges.
- Track my progress and build a collection of useful code snippets and solutions.

## Courses

This repository follows the content and exercises from:

1. **[Sololearn Python Course](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/)**: A beginner-friendly course covering
   fundamental topics.
2. **[Programiz Python Crash Course](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming)**: A structured course focusing on
   Python basics, concepts, and common use cases.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`Sololearn/`**: Contains all the exercises, code snippets, and challenges solved from the Sololearn course.
- **`Programiz/`**: Contains code examples, lessons, and coding challenges completed from the Programiz course.
